### Installation

⚠️ Under ~~development~~ constant development 

The installation script is made for Arch, but **may** work on some Arch based distros.   

THIS IS SPECIALLY TUNED FOR ASUS ( ROG & TUF ) LAPTOPS. </br>
Consider installing asusctl   

> **Warning**
>
> Install script will auto-detect nvidia card and install nvidia-dkms drivers for your kernel.   
> Nvidia drm will be enabled in grub, so please [ensure](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA) your nvidia card supports dkms drivers/hyprland.
> If on install the resolution is incorrect pls change in ```~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf``` under monitor.
> The keybinding for utility capsule is there only for ROG and TUF laptops. For others change in ```~/.config/hypr/keybindings.conf```

Some errors might be encountered during the installation due to chroot or gpg keyring , etc </br>
To Fix them run after cloning and chmodding </br>
(Recomended to run before installing, but can be done later also if found error)
```shell
cd ~/cynageOS/Scripts
./error.sh
```

After minimal Arch install (with grub), clone and execute -
```shell
pacman -Sy git
git clone https://github.com/ekahPruthvi/cynageOS.git
sudo chmod +x cynageOS
sudo chmod -R 777 cynageOS
cd ~/cynageOS/Scripts
./install.sh
```

> **Note**
>
> You can also create your own list (for ex. `custom_apps.lst`) with all your favorite apps and pass the file as a parameter to install it -
>```shell
>./install.sh custom_apps.lst
>```

Please reboot after the install script completes and takes you to sddm login screen (or black screen) for the first time.
